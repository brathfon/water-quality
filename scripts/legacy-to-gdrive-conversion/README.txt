This script was a 1 or maybe 2 time only use script.  A lot of the files are here just to document the process.REAME.txt

create-legacy-import-files.js   the script to run the conversion
get-gdrive-site-info.sh         run to get the site names used in gdrive.  Probably need to run it in the directory with the gdrive tsv files

These are reusable for the actual update
legacy-data-team-olowalu.csv
legacy-data-team-polanui.csv
legacy-data-team-r2rn.csv
legacy-data-team-r2rs.csv

Keep these for reference.  They were used for finding mappings for data used, which sites were with which team, etc.
