But flow direction of stream water was not easy to determine: Trades appeared to push stream surface toward ocean and ocean waves appeared to move upstream (CM). Stream water looked clear, not like the brown streaks observed in the ocean.                                       |

(Note: CM in field, did all the usual things to decrease blank turbidity and as a last resort) tried to re-fill vial w/distilled H2O (from field squirt bottle). Could NOT get the Blank value lower in the field (believe water was old and contaminated so later in day got new DI water to use for this purpose for the rest of the week. Note no further problems all week). RNS - clear, low clouds over Moloka'i, high surf (2-3 ft), high tide, tape on nutrient bottle loose, temperature corrected by review of instrument |

Normally we do not read it this much, but the jump from 4.03 to 7.33 to 3.60 was so great we werent sure what was happenning until we noticed the car moving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
