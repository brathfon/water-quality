files water_quality.2018-03-17_15-46-28.sql and diff_report.2018-03-17_15-46-28.tsv:
  The represent the data from:
        xfer/insert-webexport-legacy-data.sql
        xfer/insert-data-sessions-28-35-1-8.sql
        xfer/update-nutrient-data.sql

They were tested round robin: dumped down the two files, rebuild database with the sql file,
then dumped down again and all was equal.

water_quality.2018-03-19_08-17-07.sql and diff_report.2018-03-19_08-17-07.tsv
Changed the basic types of the parameters from FLOAT to DOUBLE after seeing a
problem with not enough precision on the lat/lons.  No differences in report output.
Did a round robin of installing db from dump output and all good.

diff report.2018-04-02_19-04-04.txt report.2018-04-02_18-05-15.txt shows no diffs because
qa_issue_samples data does not get diffed, and that is a problem.

Found a problem with order of dates due to m/d/yy vs mm/dd/yy.  These diffs reflect that.
Have to really use the head command to see that the only difference is in the date

Found more data problems in insitu data: some station IDs and SampleIDs not matching (inconsistant between the IDs)
So preparing to pull in 28-43 and 1-18 along with fixes to insitu for session 16 and 17 South and session 15s nutrient remeasure.

So first reloaded in data with errors as a start, but will also compare back to pre-add-42w-17s, too.
No diffs for all comparisions

Saw expected differences. 43W is new.  16-17s diffs for stationID problem, 15s nutrients back in, 18s is new.

Went back a little further and diffed before these attempted inserts:

compared *post-addition-of-36w-11s-nutrient-data.txt .*post-add-28-43-1-18-nutr-fix-15w.txt
Should only see new data for 40-43 sessions on west for insitu, 16-18 on south, which I did
Should only see new nutrient data for 37 through 39 west and 12 through 15 south, which I did.

3656137636 425631 sample-report.2018-11-11_12-07-38.pre-add-47w-22s.txt

After the insert of the data, all checked out except seeing some different order of empty collects in south lab in older sessions 19, and 20.
Not sure what is causing the difference.  Lined them up here to show that they have the same difference.  I suspect that the difference
is just that they all have starting times of 00:00, which is how they are ordered, so they probably are just being ordered randomly.

Looks good.  Saw differences between 40-46 west nutrient changing from NULL to values, same for 16-21 south
Still seeing some diffs in comments and insitu due to random order due to null values for time.

Rerunning new nutrient data for sessions up to 46 west and 21 south.  There was an entry in MNMRC_180626_S.Maui.xls that duplicated site WKB sampleID.
The normal order of collection is WKD, then WKB.  This was verified with Sofia and the correction made in the data file.

Expected diffs were seen.  Also still seeing diffs due to 0:00 times in some of the uncollected sites.

Checking merging of master into vue-conversion (development), where sessions 1-43 and 1-18 are initially being populated with the date_time separated into the_date and the_time.  Next step will be to load sessions 1-47 and 1-22 in with new conversion script that handles the_date and the_time.

Seeing some lines that are reported as diffs, but not seeing anying different, but related to the 00:00 time of uncollected data.
Only seeing them in insitu and nutrient reports, other show no diffs.

Also did the web export process and found no diffs between this data and the last web export, so looking GOOD!

Changed two things: added in the use of sampling_order to older data to stop the problem of random diffs when there were
no samples taken and all times were 0:00, and then changed the script to put in NULL instead of 0:00 when times were
not recorded.  Saw the expected diffs from 0:00 to NULL, and also saw that tests are now repeatable without the random
order changes.

Adding in insitu sessions 52-54 west and 28-30 south and saw expected results but did some order problems (AGAIN) where times are NULL.  Think that that reporting sql queries are not using the new sample_order field.

Still was having diffs in reports for samples with NULL times due to random ordering.  Found that I did not use the sampling_order field in the views for the reports, which was added to fix this problem.
Results showed that this fixed the problem (example was session 19, 2018-08-23 where all the times were NULL, not sampling that day). All diffs were expected except for the ones below, but each has
an explanation, all due to samples be taken out of order from the data sheet.
