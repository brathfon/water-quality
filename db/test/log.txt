files water_quality.2018-03-17_15-46-28.sql and diff_report.2018-03-17_15-46-28.tsv:
  The represent the data from:
        xfer/insert-webexport-legacy-data.sql
        xfer/insert-data-sessions-28-35-1-8.sql
        xfer/update-nutrient-data.sql

They were tested round robin: dumped down the two files, rebuild database with the sql file,
then dumped down again and all was equal.

water_quality.2018-03-19_08-17-07.sql and diff_report.2018-03-19_08-17-07.tsv
Changed the basic types of the parameters from FLOAT to DOUBLE after seeing a
problem with not enough precision on the lat/lons.  No differences in report output.
Did a round robin of installing db from dump output and all good.

Dana decided to QA out some entries.  had to change some scripts, but saw expected differences.
report.2018-04-02_11-16-19.txt vs report.2018-04-02_18-05-15.txt

More QA changes.  Prior diffs did not reflect changes to the qa_issue_samples table.
diff water_quality.2018-04-02_18-05-15.sql water_quality.2018-04-02_19-04-04.sql
diff report.2018-04-02_19-04-04.txt report.2018-04-02_18-05-15.txt shows no diffs because
qa_issue_samples data does not get diffed, and that is a problem.

Found a problem with order of dates due to m/d/yy vs mm/dd/yy.  These diffs reflect that.
Have to really use the head command to see that the only difference is in the date

diff report.2018-04-03_08-04-12.txt report.2018-04-06_13-02-01.txt

add comments to the inserts from the gdrive spread sheets.
diff report.2018-05-15_09-24-59.txt sample-report.2018-05-15_12-27-56.comments-added.txt  no diffs
also created two reports, one for samples, one for comments, since the comments are so long and
would make diffing hard.
Also, eliminated the tab separated files being generated and added a tag to the names for better descriptions
