  The represent the data from:
        xfer/insert-webexport-legacy-data.sql
        xfer/insert-data-sessions-28-35-1-8.sql
        xfer/update-nutrient-data.sql

They were tested round robin: dumped down the two files, rebuild database with the sql file,
then dumped down again and all was equal.

water_quality.2018-03-19_08-17-07.sql and diff_report.2018-03-19_08-17-07.tsv
Changed the basic types of the parameters from FLOAT to DOUBLE after seeing a
problem with not enough precision on the lat/lons.  No differences in report ouput.
Did a round robin of installing db from dump output and all good.
